# Internship Work - Dona Project

This repository contains my work for the internship project related to the Dona Project.
I will be writing code in Python for tasks related to:

## Data Analysis

## Data Visualization


The work will involve using libraries such as:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn (if needed for analysis)



All code, data files, and visualizations will be organized here for easy access and version control.

## Structure

.ipynb files: Jupyter notebooks containing analysis and visualization scripts

.csv files: Datasets used for analysis

.png files: Saved plots and graphs

## Goal

The main objective is to apply Python programming to analyze datasets and create meaningful visualizations that help understand and present insights for the Dona Project.
